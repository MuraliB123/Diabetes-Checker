Diabetes Checker
This projects provides easy monitoring to detect the chances of diabetes among women .
Machine learning approach 
1 imported the dataset from kaggle and removed unneccessary columns 
2 EDA is performed
3 outliers are treated by quantile method and the min and max percentile is manually fixed for each feature column
4 collinearity is observed and redundant features are removed 
5 Box plots and scatter plots are created 
6 Classification algorithms are implemented and performance metrices are noted
7 Cross validation is perfomed to find optimum kernal for Support Vector Classifier
8 SMOTE sampling is done 
9 analysed the performance metrics report and found the optimum algorithm
10 dumped into pickle file
